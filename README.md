This open source solution is providing you with temperature monitoring for your rigs.
 
### :star: Features
 - Open source. You see everything what's inside ;)
 - Written in Java. This means it works both for Windows & Linux
 - Works both for AMD / Nvidia GPUs.
 - Mobile Friendly -> perfect for a tablet / phone (set the font lower/higher) 

### :point_up: How to build it

- You should have some basic java knowledge and know what gradle is. Without 
this, it would be very hard
- You find the client (what you install on the rigs) under the client folder.
- On your rigs you need to install JAVA JRE in order to run it becaues it's
written in java.
- Both the client and the server have some starting scripts. Check them out.
- In principle, since we live in a dark world where every hacker is trying
to hack your wallet/rigs, you should always look over the code.
- The good news is that the code for this, is REALLY, REALLY small. If one
has java knowledge it will be about 3 min to see everything what's inside.
- You cannot run it on a VPS with 512mb or RAM because the spring boot will complain.
ensure you have 1-2GB of RAM available. 

 
### :sunglasses: Tips
 
 You have an old tablet (android) laying around with no use. Now it can be like
 a digital photo frame. Make sure you go into developer mode, check the
 stay awake while charging option, and point it to the server ip. 

### :rage: Troubleshooting

- I get the Permission Denied when I load the server page:
  Make sure you whitelist your IP in SecurityConfig file.
- I cannot get the client working:
  Spend some time learning how java and gradle work or give a message here ->
- I cannot get the server working:
  Spend some time learning how java, gradle and spring framework work or give 
  a message here ->
